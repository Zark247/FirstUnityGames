## 2 Project samples:  
* [Cube Sprint](https://zark247.github.io/Cube-Sprint/): first game created with help from a tutorial (click the title to play the game in browser).  
* [TestVita](https://zark247.github.io/Simple-Maze/)(SimpleMaze): applying what I learned in a tutorial to a different platform (PS Vita), (click the link to play the game in browser). The .vpk file is the executable game file (must be run on a PS Vita).
