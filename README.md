# m3-Zark247
## 2 Project samples:  
* [Cube Sprint](https://zark247.github.io/Cube-Sprint/): first game created with help from a tutorial (click the title to play the game in browser).  
* TestVita: applying what I learned in a tutorial to a different platform (PS Vita). The .vpk file is the executable game file (must be run on a PS Vita).
